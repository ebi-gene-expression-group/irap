IRAP - Integrated RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline

iRAP is a flexible RNA-seq analysis pipeline that allows the user to
  select and apply their preferred combination of existing tools for
  mapping reads, quantifying expression and testing for differential
  expression. Depending upon the application, iRAP can be used to
  quantify expression at the gene, exon or transcript level.

Please consult the wiki (https://github.com/nunofonseca/irap/wiki) for
further information.


Problems? Errors?

Errors may occur while running one of the many different pieces of
software included in IRAP (e.g., a mapper, a quantification method,
etc). If this happens then please report the error directly to
the developers of the program.

The authors of IRAP always appreciate receiving suggestions for
improvements, and reports of bugs in the pipeline or in the
documentation. Please submit them through
https://github.com/nunofonseca/irap/issues
